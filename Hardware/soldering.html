<p>During my soldering course, we watched industry standard videos, Practiced soldering techniques and soldered PCBs</p>
<p>All components of the PCBs below have been soldered by me</p>

        trace. After finishing soldering this Freeduino (compatible with Arduino software/hardware, expect cheaper) the
        teacher tested the board with a program, and it did not work. After re-soldering the board and it still not
        working my teacher examined the board. Eventually he found an extra bit of copper etching connecting these two
        pins that was not present on other boards. My teacher scratched it out and tried again but it had killed the
        chip.</p>
