<div class="center-text"><h1>Arduino projects</h1></div>
<p>throughout my Arduino course I have recorded some videos demonstrating a task on an assignment Each assignment would
    have between 7 and 10 task and you had to do between 6 and 8 </p>
<p>(Ex. Serial communicating: computer to Arduino, Arduino to
    computer, Master Write to Slave Receivers, FSK (software) modem, Wifi shield, LED wireless communication, UART
    arduino to arduino. )</p>
<p>For the assignments I did all of the tasks, including the ones I didn't have to. I got full marks for every task
    except 2 (getting an image from a camera module on the Arduino mega, and one shown below), but marks don't go above
    100%</p>

    <p>This video is showing a clear LED being used as a photoresistor. this is the other task I did not get full points
        for, I got half points. The task wanted one LED to blink and have the other LED (photodiode) detect when it's on or off. </p>
