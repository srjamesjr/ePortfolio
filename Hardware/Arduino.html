<p>throughout my Arduino course I have recorded some videos demonstrating a task on an assignment Each assignment would
    have between 7 and 10 task and you had to do between 6 and 8 </p>
<p>(Ex. Serial communicating: computer to Arduino, Arduino to
    computer, Master Write to Slave Receivers, FSK (software) modem, Wifi shield, LED wireless communication, UART
    arduino to arduino. )</p>
<p>For the assignments I did all of the tasks, including the ones I didn't have to. I got full marks for every task
    except 2 (getting an image from a camera module on the Arduino mega, and one shown below)</p>

    <p>This video is showing a clear LED being used as a photoresistor. this is the other task I did not get full points
        for, I got half points. The task wanted one LED to blink and have the other LED (photodiode) detect when it's on
        or off.

    <p>With this assignment (because it was easy), I didn’t want to keep calling my teacher over review each task, so I
        combined them all into one program. The speed of the scanner lights is controlled by a potentiometer. The
        brightness of the LED is incremented up or down based on the button held. There is a button to switch the 7-seg
        between scanner lights and two separate counters, one goes up (to 60) and the other down (from 10) </p>

    <p>Using putty, I serially send characters to the Arduino and they appear in correct order on an LCD shield.

    <p>I use SPI to have two Arduinos send data between them. The closest Arduino, with the piece of paper “SL” is the
        slave.

    <p>This is running on a raspberry pi. For my programming class we had to make a Morse coder/decoder and I had a
        salvaged speaker. I modified the program to run on the raspberry pi giving GPIO outputs for the LED and speaker
        (In python)

    <p> This is my final Embedded controller course project: A portable Emulator. It’s a raspberry pi, running an
        emulator, to a 480p LCD screen, with a breadboard of buttons, duct taped to a hollowed ps2 controller, running
        on a battery bank.
    </p>
    <p>I didn’t have a lot of time or resources to put this project together. I am using Mednafen emulator, and a
        background process to read the button presses and simulate keyboard presses. You could also connect it up to a
        monitor with HDMI and the display would auto switch. I only had half a week to do this project so I couldn’t 3d
        print or perf-board any components, which makes it look a lot less cool than it is
