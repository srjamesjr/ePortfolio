<div class="center-text"><h1>Project Blackbird: Digital negotiator</h1></div>
<div class="center-text"><h3>Version 1</h3></div>
<p>For my first year’s Work Term I volunteered for Project Blackbird. I was in a team of 4 working to create a website
    game codenamed: Digital Negotiator. A Turn-based IT business simulation game.</p>
<p>This project has taught me more than any other project, even though I consider the final result a failure. I put a
    lot of my free time into learning and writing more code (far more then the 200 hours required). We did get this
    version to a playable state, though I doubt it would be much fun.</p>
<p>Sadly I didn’t save any pictures from this version of the game. I have the code but not the database, so I couldn’t load
    the website. I also couldn’t remove the database code because almost everything that was displayed was taken from
    the DB so it would be pointless.</p>

<button class="collapsible">The Product: ▼</button>
<div class="section">
    <p>In this game you create a company. Companies can create products, hire employees, expand to regions. There are 16
        types of products, products generate you money based on your employees skills, the regions your in, and the
        amount of other people with the same product.</p>
    <p> Employees have 6 skills with values 20 to 200, each effects a different aspect of the product based on the total
        amount of the skill in the company. In the game there are a limited number of employees, and only a few get
        added every round. Employees can be trained but will cost more per round.</p>
    <p>Regions provide separate markets for products to compete in market share. Products and employees are tradeable to
        other players. </p>
    <p>My first contributions to this project was I created wireframes (15 pages), mechanics document, and a ERD (very
        primitive because I didn’t have much DB experience) though these barley got used. I did continue to update the
        mechanics document.</p>
    <p>When I started coding, I felt more comfortable doing backend because PHP was closer to languages I already knew.
        The second year created a DAO and a controller for it, I used the controller as reference to create 8 more
        controllers for every table we had. </p>
    <p>I also made a ‘controller’ for the game, handling the things that would happen at the end of a round. Per person
        this controller adds there revenue and subtracts their overhead costs. Overhead is simpler, each product has a
        cost per round per level per region, and each employee has a cost per round.</p>
    <p>To calculate your revenue, there are a lot of factors. The products (of your company) is what generates revenue,
        to determine how much depends on the products quality and the products popularity. The quality of the product is
        determined with the following equation using your company’s total values in these skills (sqrt (technical *
        (technical + organization + leadership)/3))</p>
    <p>Popularity is a lot more complicated. Revenue is calculated independently for each region, because each region
        has a ‘population’ number. There is a hype system that is controlled though semi-random events and shown on a
        news page. Using the equation(y=12.15x^3-115x^2+315x-169) or log{1.12}X+50 depending on if there is an event,
        The Y value becomes a modifier for the population. The events are based on real life popularity of products then
        randomized over 20 years (each round being 4ish years). Next every product of the same type in the same region
        has a market share, this is calculated into a percent using all companies total market skill. The popularity of
        a product is determined by %market share times the modified population times another modifier based on the level
        of the product</p>
    <p>Most of the revenue equations are just silly, there’s no need for them. At the time I guess I just wanted to play
        around with equations. </p>

<button class="collapsible">What I've Learned: ▼</button>
<div class="section">
    <p>When I first joined project blackbird, I had no experience in anything close to website developing. The
        stakeholders and my team were aware of this. Others on the team where also missing some skills (php), so first
        week was dedicated to learning the languages. </p>
    <p>There were quite a few things that went wrong with this first work term. A big one was the direction, our only
        instructions for the game was to incorporate “the business cycle”, be about the IT industry and allow players to
        make trades/deals.</p>
    <p>The first draft of document that contained all the mechanics of the game was made by the Project Manager and
        approved. It was an employee management, that eventually turned into a business simulation and incremental style
        game. I created all the mechanics documents after the first, I rewrote that document every week (including the
        first week because I felt I understood the languages enough to start after a few days.). Over time the direction
        of this game became clear, the problem was that it wasn’t the direction we started with.</p>
    <p>Scope creep is always a problem, with our project it was necessary but also, it’s downfall. We had very little to
        start with, so we had to grow the scope to have anything to develop. When a stakeholder would point us in a
        direction, we would all come up with ideas, most of those ideas would make it in. when the direction of the game
        would slightly change, we would merge the new ideas with what we already had. This caused the game to become
        quite confusing.</p>
    <p>Our communication was also lacking, we did communicate, and have the daily scrum, we just didn’t share many
        details. We all just did our own thing, this lead to the website being very separate and disjointed with not
        direct theme.</p>
