<div class="center-text"><h3>Version 2 + redesign</h3></div>
<p>After the first year’s work term I still had a lot of passion for getting this game into something I could be proud
    of. </p>
<p>For the Restructure I worked on a team of 5, with me and another from the original project. For the work term I
    worked on a team of 6 (entirely different people then the restructuring besides me) </p>

<div class="section">
    <p>Over Christmas break I had an idea, I would re create that game from the ground up to be slightly simpler and
        more cohesive. I got less then halfway though before the break ended, but I kept at it. </p>
    <p>Shortly after the end of Christmas break, the owner of Project blackbird brought up last years work, and we began
        talking about next year. We came up with the idea to have a Capstone project during the year to design the game,
        then have the work term to create it.</p>
    <p>Capstone projects are a dedicated class in your last semester; however, CET’s are unique. My last year was split
        into quarters instead of semesters, and the final quarter I only have two classes. One of them being the final
        project. Another thing with CET’s is that our final project has to be Hardware related.</p>
    <p>This redesigning couldn’t be my final project, but I still put all of my free time into it. I got no credit for
        it but was one of the largest contributors until the final month (when I needed to focus on presentations,
        documentation, and the final crunch of my own capstone).</p>
    <p>Our team was made of five people, only two of us (the two first years) from last year. We had a meeting every
        week with this team and the stakeholders. In this meeting we pitched ideas, showed new mechanics, refined
        details, hammered out the ‘problems’ this program was trying to solve, brought up games and systems to use a
        reference/inspiration, physical prototype testing.</p>
    <p>Every meeting was very productive. We went though 4 or 5 completely different designs (total) before settling
        down. We would refine it, test it, then see if something else worked better. </p>
    <p>My second to final design was based on being a TCG (like Magic: The Gathering, yu-gi-oh, Hearthstone) it was very
        unique, and I still haven’t found a game that’s similar. (The Bang! Card game is the closest, but my game has no
        combat, and no characters)</p>
    <p>For this version I had printed and sleeved over 250 cards for test playing the game. I had created 97 unique
        cards each with their own effect, I spent quite some time balancing the numbers and effects. We all like this
        idea. We gave the mid-way though capstone presentation on it but it had a problem, Digital Negotiator is meant
        to be played by 100s of people and I created a turn based card game.</p>
    <p>The other guys came up with a more simplified version, but I didn’t like the things they changed, and there were
        some flaws, I stubbornly kept insisting on my game without even testing theirs. A couple days later, really late
        at night I realised I wasn’t being completely fair and delved into there game again. </p>
    <p>Then I had a eureka moment, I thought exactly “theirs was simpler, but what if it’s not simple enough”. I was
        filled with inspiration and worked on this until our next meeting. I pitched this new designed and we discussed
        how it meet all of the criteria and opened new interactions that we didn’t even know we wanted until we seen
        them. When the owner of Project Blackbird got physically excited, I knew this was going to be awesome.</p>

<button class="collapsible">The Product: ▼</button>
<div class="section">
    <p>Digital negotiator is a card-based game about trading to complete a goal, designed to make players interact
        outside of the website.</p>
    <p>Each player has 8 cards, each card has 2 categories that it will give ether 1 or 2 points to. A player will have
        a goal to get a certain amount of points in a few categories. To get the cards that you need you will have to
        trade with another player, but that player is also looking for cards they need.</p>


    <p>The first picture is the landing page, and the second picture is the home page for when you log in. the home page
        provides a full set of instructions for the game. The faint image in the background was drawn by me.</p>


    <p>This is one of the main pages ‘my cards’ this page shows you the cards you own, and your goal. It also calculates
        your totals (for ease) and keeps track of your Victory points. Victory points are earned every time you complete
        a goal. The background/banner, The Cards, and the Victory point counter were all drawn by me. I also coded the
        front-end and the back-end of this page.</p>


    <p>When you have the required cards to complete a goal, it goes super Saiyan. I drew this as well. Goal cards when
        generated are not random at all. They choose categories that you have the least points in to maximize the amount
        of trades you will need to make to complete the goal.</p>


    <p>This is the first trading page. On this page you can initiate a trade with another player (taking you to the
        second trading page), you can see trades that you’ve proposed (outgoing) and trades others are requesting of
        you. </p>
    <p>One big design challenge we had was that trading was required to have some interaction outside the game. I had
        the idea (during the restructure) that the player proposing the trade was given a code, and the player accepting
        the trade had to enter that code for the deal to be made. This would force players to have a small amount of
        communication to perform a trade. </p>
    <p>The social aspect of this game was the number one thing the client wanted. If your going to do one trade with a
        person your likely to do multiple trades if there is still benefit, this will get the two people talking and
        maybe form an alliance. </p>
    <p>Also, to enforce the social aspect, the only way to see another person’s cards is to enter their W number (A
        unique number ever NSCC has). This means before you make a trade you’ll want to ask if the person even cards has
        you need. Making deals with someone you’ve already traded with is easier because of auto-fill. This could form
        alliances, but ether way it’s people interacting with each other outside of the game</p>
    <p>This system works for people who are shy or introverted because the people who aren’t shy, or people who are
        invested in the game will go to the shier people to trade with them. Especially if your competitive and don’t
        want to trade with the guy that’s close to having more points then you. </p>


    <p>This is the second trading page where you chose the cards you want to trade. Greyed out cards are ones that are
        currently in an offer, and red means the current selected one.</p>


    <p>This feature is: inventions, it’s currently very bare bones and will be what next years team focus on. We have
        some solid ideas for what the finished invention mechanic will do.</p>
    <p>Right now, when you complete a goal, you get a Victory point and an innovation point. Innovation points are spent
        on Inventions, but you can only be developing 2 inventions at a time. At the end of a week (or set time frame)
        The 2 inventions with the most points will be invented giving all players a few bonus victory points. (the
        amount of inventions at the start would be around 8 but more are added every round)</p>
    <p>Some Inventions have prerequisite inventions that need to be invented before being available (EX. To have CDs,
        first floppy disks need to be invented). By the end of the game this will have created a timeline/history of how
        technology progressed in this world.</p>
    <p>This is a system that does not require social interaction but does reward it. If you’ve networked with a few
        people, you can all work together to develop the same invention. More active players would also talk to the
        shier players to get their points. </p>


    <p>This is the Leaderboards page, where you can see the top 10 people with the most victory points, or you can see
        everyone’s placing in a class. Having a leaderboard will give some players the sense of competition, maybe to be
        better than everyone, or best in their class, or just better than their friends. This leaderboard could also be
        a good way of finding other people.</p>


    <p>There are 3 admin pages, I wont include screenshots from most of the sections on them because everything looks
        and functions similarly. The first admin page has the controls for starting the game, The second admin page has
        controls for the game elements, and the 3rd admin is for seeing user metrics.</p>
    <p> The first admin page contains the buttons to generate cards (research and goal cards) you can do this based on
        users who don’t have cards, by induvial user (users can also be searched and filtered), or you can do it by
        course. Course is another thing you can create on this page. When a user creates an account, they are required
        enter a course, the course has to be open for them to make the account (open/closed controlled on this page
        too.) This first page lets you manually end a round and reset all inventions. There is also an option to prevent
        all users from logging in.</p>
    <p>The second page lets you manually add, remove or edit various game elements. Things such as the current round,
        the in game year (used for inventions history), the amount of years a round is, the inventions per round. This
        page also lets you control the categories (the amount and their names), The templates goals are based off, and
        Inventions (adding new ones or changing names, descriptions, prerequisites)</p>
    <p>The third admin pages show detailed statics for each user. Things like Total trades, accepted, declined, cancel
        trades, goals completed, inventions completed. There are filtering and sorting tools for all this data. When
        designing mechanics that used the database, I had a data analysts in mind. I wanted to keep as much data as we
        could and have it all time stamped so in the future someone might be able to learn something from it. </p>


    <p>These admin pages where designed with constant feedback from the client (the main person going to be using it)
        everything is sectioned out and each interactable has detailed description on what it does. It can handle when
        people join late, or too many people stop playing. If some aspect of the game because unbalanced, more of less
        of whatever it is can be added or subtracted. The owner specifically requested everything in the User metrics
        page. </p>

<button class="collapsible">What I've Learned: ▼</button>
<div class="section">
    <p>I learned a lot from this project. This was the first time I was in a leadership role, I started as just the
        Product owner, but I also did a lot of full-stack development, and GitHub branch management (With the client
        meetings, presentations, backlog, documentation)</p>
    <p> One of the first things I had to do was create a Team Charter, I had never made a team charter before, so I had
        to get help from the team and from Project Blackbirds owner. I had to remake this document a few times and after
        the presentation/meeting showing our team charter I still had a few things wrong that I corrected directly after
        (one thing being, I had a goal statement, but I was supposed to have a scope in point form)</p>
    <p>At the start, my communication with the team was pretty rocky. My team didn’t know very much about the project
        (because they where just starting), and I was a bit overwhelmed with not knowing how to direct the team. This
        caused a day or two where not much was happening, while I while I worked out a backlog, setup a GitHub, made a
        presentation/demonstration of how the game (I didn’t communicate I was doing this to the team). I was also
        pretty shy for the first few days. I made a set of physical cards to show a playthrough of the game to help
        understanding (these cards where actually the best thing I created because I used them daily to help explain my
        thought processes) I printed and sleeve 84 cards. After walking everyone through the game I had more confidence
        in myself. I then made sure that everything I was doing, and thinking was known to the team, any changed or
        potential decisions became group discussions </p>
    <p>4/6 of our team was first years, split based on what they preferred to front-end and back-end. The first years
        working on backend had to learn both PHP, and Laravel, A programing teacher on the internal steering committee
        suggested the rest of the first week and a second week to learn. I spent one full day learning Laravel so that
        me and the senior developer could get something ready for the sprint review. </p>
    <p>I didn’t stop coding after that though, I kept working on back-end and front-end of pages. For this work term
        even after hours and on weekends this project was the only thing I did. I was super passionate about making this
        the best project it could be and put all the effort I could into it.</p>
    <p>at the end of the 3rd week (maybe second) we wanted to show the website in the sprint review on the live server.
        I complete forgot about this, the Senior developer and DevOps also missed it. Our development VMs were running
        the latest versions of php/Laravel, but the server was running an older version. The server couldn’t be updated
        (security/stability issue I think) and when we tried to downgrade our code we ran into many errors. I downgraded
        my VM, then I spent the whole weekend rewriting the entire project. (some things could be copied but some things
        needed to be changed)</p>
    <p>For our last and second last sprint reviews we performed full game tests. We got other development teams to come
        in and play a full start to finish game (about 20 people total), while our team carefully observed. For the
        first test we gave as little direction/guidance/help as we could, we told them how to accept trades, and that
        they needed to complete goals. We wanted to see if our UI and mechanics were intuitive. We also paid great
        attention to who people where trading with (friends/non-friends), patterns with who their trading (asking the
        same few people or branching out), we looked for balance (whether completing goals was easy/hard based on the
        amount of categories of values on the goal card). This test was hugely valuable, and we slightly adjusted many
        things to hone in on the experience we where looking for.</p>
    <p>The second test, done a week later was by the request of the internal steering committee to test security. The
        teams on other projects had the same tests on their project, where everyone tried to break your website. Ours
        held up extremely well (we did have fewer potential breaking then other project), the worse thing that happened
        was a users display name could be 64 capital ‘W’, we made display names more restricted, but an admin can change
        users’ names. </p>
    <p>For the final presentations I was super nervous because there was a CEO from a company there to critique the
        presentation. The CEO thought my presentation was great. He really like the game itself and what it
        accomplished. He commented that he liked how everything had design reasons and mechanic reasons, and how I
        talked about the design reasons while my teammate on the computer got ready to show it’s mechanics and explained
        them. </p>
