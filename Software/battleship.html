<div class="center-text"><h1>Python Battleship</h1></div>
<p>As one of my first programs in college I was tasked with creating a game in python for a command line interface. This
    game was to be a 10x8 that different sized ships would be randomly generated onto and the user had to sink all the
    ships.</p>
<p>I decided to make my game more advanced and created the full game of Battleship with graphics and finished within the
    same deadline. </p>
<p>I spent very little time creating the images use in this project, focusing mostly on function. This makes the game
    visually look awful. </p>

    <p style="margin: 50px 0 50px 0;"> The program starts with a main menu giving you the option to choose how many
        players. ‘one player’ is you versus the computer, and ‘two player’ is with two users taking turns.</p>

    <p style="margin: 50px 0 0 0;">These images show the game. The first image shows boats being placed, the second
        shows the attacking phase.</p>
    <p>While setting up your boats, you are prevented from moving or rotating a ship outside the grid. When all your
        ships are placed it will become the second players turn to place theirs (or the computers who places them near
        instantly). </p>
    <p>During the attack phase you move a cursor around the grid to choose a place to fire, misses and hits are marked
        with different images. You and player two (or the computer) take turns firing until all of one person’s ships
        have been sunk, they are the loser.</p>

<button class="collapsible">What I've Learned: ▼</button>
<div class="section">
    <p> Scope: this was my first project that was more then a simple learning exercise. The original assignment was
        meant to be simple, but I greatly increased the scope. I had to consider the deadline and work efficiently,
        which for the proof of concept/learning programs I had written previously, time wasn’t a concern. I had to cut
        corners (graphics) and leave out some features I wanted (different missile sizes, a not 100% RNG computer
        player). This project helped me decide for all future projects how much more can I do then the recommended
        assignment. </p>
    <p>Importance of OOP and Separation of Concerns: When doing this project, I had no idea about OOP or why/how you’d
        want to separate code in different files. The next semester, when we learned OOP this project was an amazing
        point of reference for me. Sometimes its hard to see why a concept would be useful when the program your writing
        to learn is very small. I was able to understand the usefulness quickly when I would think of it’s use case in
        my battleship program.
        EX. When we first learned about objects most people thought it was a more complicated way to make a variable,
        where I thought back to the 4 dimensional array I was using to store boat information. Or when my class learned
        about things like separating graphics code from calculating code, I could remember how difficult it was to
        navigate and modify my code until I separated it.</p>
    <p>Comments: All programs I’ve created up until this point where short and only preformed one task, because of this
        I didn’t fully understand why commenting was stressed so much. As my program grew, I quickly found out how
        important they were; when I was wasting time trying to figure out what the chunk of code I wrote the previous
        day did. Because of my lack of OOP, comments were vital in understanding what each place in the many
        multi-dimensional arrays were storing. </p>
