<div class="center-text"><h1>Turn-Based RPG</h1></div>
<p>For my third java assignment I had to create a turn-based text-based fighting game using OOP and jframes. Where
    buttons would be used to attack and upgrade your character, and the fight (damage numbers) would be visible in a
    combat log.</p>
<p>I decided to make my game more advanced and added RPG elements such as characters, spells, status effects, and
    weapons to choose from. I added a system like actions in DnD and I made it more graphical.</p>
<p>All images where drawn by me, expect I’m not a very good artist so it takes a long time.(I am proud
    of two of the swords I drew). As the deadline for this project grow near the time spent on graphics was the first to
    be sacrificed.</p>

    <p style="margin: 40px 0 40px 0;">The program starts with a main menu that only has one option but, brings you to
        the next menu that lets you choose which character you want to select. Each character has 6 unique spells that
        will have an effect in a fight. You can only choose 3 of these spells per playthrough, some are more helpful
        then others.</p>

    <p style="margin: 40px 0 40px 0;">The order in which you pick you spells will affect their order on the screen. I
        did
        this to learn about how games allow things like rebinding keys and customizing HUDs/interfaces. Each spell also
        has a cooldown, some you can use every turn, others only once every 2 or 3 turns. This is also where the
        graphics go down hill.</p>

    <p>Once your in the game you’ll see a lot of things on screen. The very bottom is your spells, while in combat
        clicking them will use them. Basic attack attacks with your weapon instead of a spell. Above your spells you
        have a health bar as a percentage, and your actions (the circles). The blue action is used once on your turn (it
        will end your turn), the 3 red actions are used once per fight (it will remain your turn). Spells are
        color-coded showing which action they will use. Above your health bar status effects will show up, some weaken
        you, some damage you every round, some make you stronger.</p>

    <p>When you defeat an enemy, you get gold that you can use to buy weapons. The weapons each have the effect of two
        spells and do some damage. The player can only have one sword equipped at a time, and only attack once per
        fight</p>

<button class="collapsible">What I've Learned: ▼</button>
<div class="section">
    <p>OOP: The assignment was created for the class to use some OOP (inheritance and encapsulation). With my addition’s
        polymorphism and composition were also used. Spells and weapons used late binding and were “Has-A”
        relationships, the player and the enemy were also used polymorphic because of the multiple characters they could
        be.</p>
    <p>Scope creep: For this project I noticed that the more features I implemented the more ideas I would get about
        more things to implement. As the deadline grew near, I had to rush to get what I did have working. You can see
        this by looking at the decrease in graphical quality over time.</p>
